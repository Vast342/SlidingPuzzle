# N-Puzzle AI Experimentation in Processing
This project consists of 2 main objectives
1. Create an N-Puzzle application to generate them randomly and be able to solve them.
2. Create an AI to solve them, and train it using a genetic algorithm.

So far I have created the application, and am now preparing it to be adapted for AI in the Attempt 2 folder. This process involves essentially transferring over most of the code and adjusting it to support multiple boards simultaneously using a dedicated class.
