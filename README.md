# N-Puzzle AI Experimentation in Processing
This project consists of 2 main objectives
1. Create an N-Puzzle application with which to randomly generate and solve them.
2. Create an AI to solve them, and train it using a genetic algorithm.
So far I have created the application, and am now preparing it to be adapted for AI in the Attempt_2 file.
